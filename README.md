# Evo-algo
Genetic algorithm for image evoluting
# The computer's ART
## The algorithm using the standard approach of Genetic Algorithm
- to make population
- to make muation
- to make clonning (reproduction) based on whole population
- to make selection
- to make crossover
- using fintess function based on random generating function
## The main idea to have successful (decreasing every time) fintess function, we should pay attention to:
- mutation function
- selection that decreases the fintess score every genearting
## How to run .exe file to play with this project
> Gui/bin/Release/GenArt.exe ;
## This drawing image project has their own NAME:
# Cosmo-post-apocalyptic avant-garde
- Why it is so:
  * Because the art for me, it is something that you can include your favorite things, add during doing you will enjoy it
  * So cosmo - beacause "StarTrek" - one of the best serial about space and discovery
  * Fallout - the best series of games about post-apocalyptic
  * Codding - it is like an art when you creating code, and then it works)
